# How to contribute

The easiest ways to contribute is to open an issue and start a discussion. 
Then we can decided if and how a feature or a change could be implemented and if you should submit a pull requests with code changes.

**We only accept PRs to the dev branch.**

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap. Here's a list of blog posts that are worth reading before doing a pull request:

* [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza
* [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](http://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.

**Tests**

-  Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
-  Tests only need to be present for issues that need to be verified by QA (e.g. not tasks)
-  If there is a scenario that is far too hard to test there does not need to be a test for it.
  - "Too hard" is determined by the team as a whole.
